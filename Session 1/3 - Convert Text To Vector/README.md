# 🔤 Text to Vector Conversion in Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🚀

In NLP projects, one of the most important steps is converting text into numbers (vectors) so that computers can process
the text 💻. There are various methods for this task, each with its own advantages and specific applications 🎯.

## 📚 Common Methods for Text to Vector Conversion

1. **Word Indexing** 🔢
   Assigning a unique number (index) to each word.

2. **Bag of Words (BoW)** 👜
   Counting the frequency of words without considering their order.

3. **TF-IDF** ⚖️
   Weighting words based on their importance in the text and the overall dataset.

4. **Word2Vec** 🧠
   Producing dense numeric vectors that preserve the semantic relationships between words.

5. **Doc2Vec**
   Doc2Vec can map an entire sentence, paragraph, or document into a dense, fixed-length vector.

6. **GloVe** 🌐
   A method similar to Word2Vec that uses overall word co-occurrence statistics.

7. **FastText** ⚡
   Creating word vectors by considering subwords, suitable for complex languages.

8. **ELMo** 🔍
   Generating context-dependent (contextual) word vectors based on the entire sentence.

## ✅ Conclusion

* For simple projects and small datasets, **Word Indexing**, **BoW**, and **TF-IDF** are fast and effective options ⚡.
* To preserve semantic relationships between words, **Word2Vec**, **Doc2Vec**, **GloVe**, and especially **FastText** (
  good for new
  words) are recommended 🧩.
* For advanced projects requiring precise understanding of context, **ELMo** is the best choice 🎓.
