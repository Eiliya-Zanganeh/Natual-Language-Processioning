# 🔢 Token Indexing (Integer Encoding) for Text to Number Conversion

## 📚 Introduction

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), one of the first text preprocessing steps is converting words into integer numbers. This allows machine learning and deep learning models to transform text into a format understandable by computers. 💻✨

## 🛠️ How It Works

* First, the text is split into words or smaller tokens (tokenization). ✂️
* Then, each word is assigned a unique integer index. 🔢
* Finally, the text is represented as a sequence of numbers (indexes). 📝➡️🔢

Simple example:
Text: `"I love NLP and I love Python"`
Converted to sequence: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 4]`

## 🤔 Why Is This Important?

* Deep learning models cannot process raw text directly. 🚫📝
* Converting words to numbers is the first step to using neural networks like LSTM, Transformer, and others. 🚀
* After this step, embeddings are usually applied to transform each number into a meaningful numeric vector. 🎯

## 👍 Advantages

* Simple and fast ⚡
* Maintains word order 📚➡️📚
* Prepares text for neural network models 🧠

## ⚠️ Disadvantages

* At this stage, the numbers carry no semantic information. ❌📖
* An embedding step is needed to learn the meaning of words. 🧩
